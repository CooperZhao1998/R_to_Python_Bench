Convert the following R (tidyverse) code to Python (choose Pandas OR Polars; prefer {LIB}).
Constraints:
1) Read input only from files in data/ (CSV or Parquet) and write nothing.
2) Produce a single DataFrame variable named out.
3) Match column order, row order, dtypes, NA placement, and factor/category levels exactly (ordered where applicable).
4) Use vectorized operations; no loops unless unavoidable.
5) Implement semi/anti joins correctly if present.
6) If behavior is ambiguous (regex, tz), state the assumption in comments and mirror Râ€™s output.
R code:
```r
{R_TASK}
```
